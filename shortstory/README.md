## Multi-Task Learning for Dense Prediction Tasks: A Survey

Multi-task learning refers to solving multiple tasks simulataneously by exploring similarities and differences between the tasks. The tasks learn from shared representations. It aims at improving performance of multiple classification tasks by learning them concurrently. The paper presents multi task learning first from a network architecture point-of-view, then it examines various optimization methods, exploring the similarities, differences, pros and cons of both the strategies.
