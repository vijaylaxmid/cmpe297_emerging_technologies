### Emerging technologies assignment 1

  - Multi instance learning
  
      Multi instance is a weakly supervised learning method, that takes a set of labeled bags containing many instances , instead of labeled instances. Instances         are in “bags” rather than sets because a given instance may be present one or more times, e.g. duplicates.The assignment problem for multi instance learning         shows how it works with a simple example based on the MNIST dataset.

  - Semi supervised learning
  
     Semi supervised learningis supervised learning where the training data contains very few labeled examples and a large number of unlabeled examples.The goal of      a semi-supervised learning model is to make effective use of all of the available data, not just the labelled data like in supervised learning. The dataset          used for semi supervised learning consists of credit card transaction. All the relevant comments are put as part of code comments
